## Mission
NDS maintains three core principles that outline its primary goals, as detailed in its mission statement below:

* To encourage and promote professional development of individuals both within and outwith the society.
* To actively engage with the tech community to both organize and participate in relevant events.
* To establish a network of open-minded tech enthusiasts who can benefit from one another.

## History
NDS was founded in 2013 at Edinburgh Napier University by Razvan Ilan. Born out of the desire to get people working together rather than on their own, it brought together individuals within the School of Computing. 

It exists today as a part of the Edinburgh Napier Students Association.
