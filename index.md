## Overview
The Napier Developers Society (NDS) is a community of individuals with a passion for technology. Membership is open to students, alumni and staff from Edinburgh Napier University as well as external individuals - beginners, hobbyists and professionals alike.

Rather than focus on one particular subject area, we accommodate a broad variety of interests. Whether you're looking to learn something specific or simply trying to find out more about technology in general, we provide many opportunities for both.

All we ask is that you're interested in challenging yourself and ready to engage in a community that supports you doing so. If you bring that enthusiasm, we'll do our best to provide everything else.
