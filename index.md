## Overview
The Napier Developers Society (NDS) is a community of individuals with a passion for technology. Membership is open to students, alumni and staff from universities as well as hobbyists and professionals alike.

Rather than focus on one particular subject or discipline within the industry, the society aims to provide a blend of different areas to help expose its members to as much as possible. 

Whether you identify as a software developer, UI/UX designer, DevOps engineer, business analyst, systems architect or something else, it will benefit you to become a member.

## Activities
NDS hosts a weekly social every Wednesday at 5:15pm in room C27 at Edinburgh Napier University's Merchiston Campus to engage with other members.

Additionally, a fortnightly event is held on alternating Tuesdays and Thursdays for presentations, tech talks and other activities.
