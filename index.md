## Overview
The Napier Developers Society (NDS) is a community of individuals with a passion for technology. Membership is open to students, alumni and staff from Edinburgh Napier University as well as external individuals, hobbyists and professionals alike.

Rather than focus on one particular subject or discipline within the industry, the organisation aims to promote a plethora of different areas to help expose its members to as much as possible. 

Whether you identify as or aspire to be a software developer, UI/UX designer, DevOps engineer, business analyst, systems architect or something else, it will benefit you to become a member.

Remember, you don't need to know anything advanced about technology; you can be a complete beginner. All we ask is that you're interested in learning.

## Activities
NDS hosts a weekly co-working space followed by socials on Wednesdays, as well as monthly Tuesday "Doing" and Thursday "Learning" events.
