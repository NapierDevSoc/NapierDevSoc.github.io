## Overview
The Napier Developers Society (NDS) is a community of individuals with a passion for technology. Membership is open to students, alumni and staff from Edinburgh Napier University as well as external individuals, hobbyists and professionals alike.

Rather than focus on one particular subject or discipline within the industry, the organisation aims to promote a plethora of different areas to help expose its members to as much as possible.

Whether you identify as or aspire to be a software developer, UI/UX designer, DevOps engineer, business analyst, systems architect or something completely different and outside of the technology industry, it will benefit you to become a member.

Remember, you don't need to know anything advanced about technology; you can be a complete beginner. All we ask is that you're interested in learning and ready to engage in a community that supports you doing so.

If you bring the enthusiasm, we'll do our best to provide everything else.

## Activities
NDS hosts a weekly co-working space followed by a pub social on Wednesdays, as well as monthly Tuesday "Doing" and Thursday "Learning" events. Between the two, we cover practical opportunities to get hands-on with technology as well as the chance to listen and learn from our guest speakers on a variety of interesting topics.
