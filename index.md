## Overview
The Napier Developers Society (NDS) is a community of individuals with a passion for technology. Membership is open to students, alumni and staff from Edinburgh Napier University as well as external individuals - hobbyists and professionals alike.

Rather than focus on one particular subject or discipline within the industry, the organisation aims to promote a plethora of different areas to help expose its members to as much as possible. 

Whether you identify as or aspire to be a software developer, UI/UX designer, DevOps engineer, business analyst, systems architect or something else, it will benefit you to become a member.

## Activities
NDS hosts a weekly social every Wednesday at Edinburgh Napier University's Merchiston Campus to engage with other members.

Additionally, a fortnightly event is held on alternating Tuesdays and Thursdays for presentations, tech talks and other activities.
