# Community
The Napier Developers Society is a strong community of individuals who network
over various different media channels. We encourage use of anything from Slack
or IRC to Twitter or Facebook. Use what you want, where you want, when you
want.

## Slack
Jump onto our Slack channels at
[napierdevsoc.slack.com](https://napierdevsoc.slack.com) for a rich,
communicative experience across all your devices. Register with your university
email for ask for an invite on an alternative address—get involved!

## IRC
We haunt the #nds channel on `chat.freenode.net`. IRC is a great platform to
reach out to many different communities online—come and join us!

## Facebook
The public page is

## Twitter
Our Twitter account is
