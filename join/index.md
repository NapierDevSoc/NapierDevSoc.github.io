## Membership
Anyone interested in technology can and should become a member of NDS. From complete beginners to seasoned professionals, the society seeks to engage everyone in discussion, events and learning.

## Benefits
In addition to the network of like-minded individuals that the NDS community provides, a number of benefits are attributed to being registered members of the society.

These include but are not be limited to:

- Priority and/or discounted entrance to any NDS organised, ticketed events
- Access to our software and services (internal wiki, server shell account, etc) and hardware inventory (Arduinos, etc)
- Much more as we develop sponsorships and partnerships throughout the coming year

## Fee
An annual fee is required to join the NDS, with the price set according to the category of membership that is attained.

The fees for each category are as follows:

- **Student Members** (Edinburgh Napier University students): **£5.00**
- **Associate Members** (Edinburgh Napier University alumni, staff or external individuals): **£10.00**

Besides the price, these memberships are identical and provide the same access to the aforementioned benefits, content and events that the NDS provides to its affiliates.

This fee does not include the cost of a Societies Union card that is both required and <a href="http://www.napierstudents.com/teamnapiersocieties/societyjoinstart/">must be purchased separately from the NSA</a>.

## Registering
In order to register as a member of NDS, you must use the <a href="http://www.napierstudents.com/login/">online portal</a> provided by the Napier Students Union. We cannot and will not take any cash to pay for your membership. If you don't already have an account, you can <a href="http://www.napierstudents.com/account/register/guest/">register here</a>.

Once you've paid your fees you will be able to go to the NSA office and receive your Societies Union card. You must bring or show a copy of your receipt as proof of purchase.
