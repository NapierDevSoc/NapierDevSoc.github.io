## Membership
From complete beginners to seasoned professionals, anyone interested can become a member of the society—not just students!

In addition to the network of like-minded individuals that the community provides here are a few benefits:

- Priority and/or discounted entrance to any NDS organised, ticketed events
- Access to our software and services (internal wiki, server shell account, etc) and hardware inventory (Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, etc)
- Much more as we develop sponsorships and partnerships throughout the coming year

## Fee
An annual fee is required to join the society but don't worry—we keep it as low as we can:

- **Student Members** (Edinburgh Napier University students): **£5.00**
- **Associate Members** (Edinburgh Napier University alumni and staff or external individuals): **£10.00**

This fee does not include the cost of a Societies Union card which <a href="http://www.napierstudents.com/teamnapiersocieties/societyjoinstart/">must be purchased separately</a> from the Edinburgh Napier Students Association.

## Registering
In order to register as a member, you must use the <a href="http://www.napierstudents.com/login/">online portal</a> provided by the Edinburgh Napier Students Union.
