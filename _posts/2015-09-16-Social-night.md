## Weekly social night
Find us at the Napier union bar upstairs in Three Sisters for our weekly social night. Meet other members of the society, grab a drink and have a relaxing time after a long day at university.

Don't miss out, become part of the community - we're a friendly bunch. Whether you're entirely new to embracing technology or not, you're most welcome.

Check out our co-working space that's on earlier in the day too!
