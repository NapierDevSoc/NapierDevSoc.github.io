## Wednesday co-working space
Every week on Wednesday a co-working space is made available to NDS members to provide a relaxed, friendly environment. No organised agenda is set out for this period, it is a chance to focus on whatever strikes your fancy.

Please check out the <a href="http://napierdevsoc.uk/events/index.html">events calendar</a> for more information.
