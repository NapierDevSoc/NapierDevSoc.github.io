## Napier Developers Society is on Slack!
Find us at <https://napierdevsoc.slack.com/> - you can register with your university (@live.napier.ac.uk) email address. If you want to use a different address, please contact a committee member and ask them to invite an address you specify.

Everyday chat is in `#general`, where every new member is added by default. There are also other channels such as `#hackathons` and ones for student year groups, `#year1` through `#year4` for Years 1 through 4 respectively.

You can learn more about Slack and how to use it [here](https://napierdevsoc.slack.com/getting-started) and through the tutorial which is started when you first sign in to Slack.

There are also Android and iOS apps available for Slack, alongside the Windows / OS X desktop apps (available [here](http://slack.com/apps)).
