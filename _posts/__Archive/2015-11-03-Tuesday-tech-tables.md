## Tuesday tech tables
At our monthly Tuesday tech tables, we'll be providing you with the tools to get hands-on while learning. Whether it's hardware, software or a combination of the two, there'll be something for everyone to tinker with.

We'll attempt to be as inclusive as possible by providing not only a variety of different things to do but by lending as much support as we can to one another, since we're all trying to have challenge ourselves and what we know.

Interested in hearing more about technology and the industry? Check out our monthly Thursday tech talks event.
