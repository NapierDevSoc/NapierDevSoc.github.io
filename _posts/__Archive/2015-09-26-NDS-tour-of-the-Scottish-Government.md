## Napier Developers Society tour of the Scottish Government

A limited number of tickets are now available for NDS members for the following event:

*Members of the Napier Developers Society studying a course from the School of Computing will be given the opportunity to get behind closed doors and into the offices of the Scottish Government. They will gain insight into how the development team operates, what roles they play and what prospects might await future employees.*

*Free lunch will be provided at the venue and any dietry requirements should be specified when ordering tickets. The group will meet in the courtyard of Merchiston Campus at 10:30 am and leave shortly after. Bus fare to pay for travel is not included and will be required.*

*Due to limited capacity for this event in particular, tickets are available on a first-come, first-serve basis only. If the event is sold out and you would like to be considered in case of any cancellations, or if you have any other queries, please email: contact@napierdevsoc.uk*
