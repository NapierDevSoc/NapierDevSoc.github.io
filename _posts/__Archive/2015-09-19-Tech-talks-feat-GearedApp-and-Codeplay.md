## Tech talks feat. GearedApp and Codeplay
NDS is excited to announce that our tech talks on Thursday the 24th of September will now include additional speakers and, of course, we're still offering free pizza at the event. It'll be from 6:00pm - 7:30pm in B2 on Merchiston Campus by the library. Everyone is welcome!

Codeplay will be joining GearedApp and Edinburgh Napier University - between them they'll talk about who they are, what they do and everything from industrial placements and start-ups to NoSQL and the enormity of Elite: Dangerous and its database.

Our complete list of speakers will now include:

- Josh Carson (Director and UI/UX Designer) from GearedApp
- Andrzej Schmidt (Director and Lead Developer) from GearedApp
- Andrew Cumming (Senior Lecturer) from Edinburgh Napier University
- Duncan McBain (Staff Software Engineer, GPGPU Systems) from Codeplay
- Meenakshi Ravindran (Staff Software Engineer, Compilers) from Codeplay
