# Tech talks feat. FanDuel

We are collaborating with Bright Red Triangle on the Thursday, 19th of November 2015 at 18:00 to welcome Andrew Williams of Fanduel to the University. We'll be in the Glassroom on Merchiston Campus.

Fanduel – if you didn’t already know – are one of the feted ‘unicorn’ billion dollar tech companies to come out of Scotland, and we’re delighted that Andrew is going to come in to tell that story, as well as the story of Kotikan.

We’re also happy to say that our very own Geared
App and Odd Panda Design will share the stage, to talk about the early stages of their company development with a view to becoming tech growth companies in Scotland themselves.

Come and be inspired. Refreshments will be provided.

Tickets available on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/fanduel-bright-red-triangle-napier-developer-society-masterclass-tickets-19248269091">Eventbrite</a>.
