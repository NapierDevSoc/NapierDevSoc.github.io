## Thursday "Learning" Event
Find us in room C30 for our monthly "Learning" Thursday. We'll bring along guest speakers to give you an insight into the industry as well as provide presentations and talks that help expose you to the latest news and technologies you should be aware of.

Don't miss out, become part of the community - we're a friendly bunch. Whether you're entirely new to embracing technology or not, you're most welcome.

Check out our monthly "Doing" Tuesdays too!
