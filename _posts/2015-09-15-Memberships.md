## Paying your membership fee
We're so glad to see so many enthusiastic individuals looking to join our society this year. It's an exciting time to get involved! Now, how do you become a valued member and pay your fee?

As detailed on our newly updated <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/join/index.html">'Join Us'</a> page, there are a few steps you need to follow:

---

*In order to register as a member of NDS, you must use the <a href="http://www.napierstudents.com/login/">online portal</a> provided by the Napier Students Union. We cannot and will not take any cash to pay for your membership. If you don't already have an account, you can <a href="http://www.napierstudents.com/account/register/guest/">register here</a>.*

*Once you've logged in, please visit our <a href="http://www.napierstudents.com/organisation/societies/developers/">society page</a> and purchase our Society Membership further down on the page. Remember, if you don't already have a Societies Union card, you will need to purchase one of these also.*

*If you have any trouble with signing up, please send an email to contact@napierdevsoc.uk and we'll provide any support we can.*

Again, we cannot and will not take any cash, but our sign-up events are a great place to speak with us about the society, receive any support you need to navigate the online portal to pay and meet other individuals like yourself!
