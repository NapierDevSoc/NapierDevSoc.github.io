## Thursday tech talks
At our monthly Thursday tech talks, we'll expose you to the latest news about technology and give you an insight to the industry as well as the people who work within it. 

We'll have presentations and discussions with guest speakers from small start-ups to larger corporations as well individuals in academia - students, lecturers and researchers.

Interested in getting hands-on with technology too? Check out our monthly Tuesday tinkering tables event.
