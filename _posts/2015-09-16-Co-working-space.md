## Weekly co-working space and sign-ups
Find us in room C30 for our weekly co-working space. Meet other members of the society, learn from their experience and share your own. 

Don't miss out, become part of the community - we're a friendly bunch. Whether you're entirely new to embracing technology or not, you're most welcome.

Check out our social night that's on later in the day too!
